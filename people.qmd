### Rolf Terje Kroglund

##### Researcher

I’m an associate professor in biology and wildlife management at Nord university in Steinkjer. In the recent years I have focused on mapping and monitoring of vulnerable and threatened species. In several of these studies we have employed satellite transmitters and light-loggers (GLS).

### Chloé R. Nater

##### Researcher

I’m a statistical ecologist working at the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research. My specialty is making the best possible use of available data by combining information from different sources and monitoring programmes in integrated models. I have done that for a large range of species including freshwater fish, resident and migratory birds, and marine and terrestrial mammals, and the list of species is still growing. Willow ptarmigan is a newer addition to my list, and I am involved in designing and maintaining reproducible analysis pipelines for data collected through [Hønsefuglportalen](https://honsefugl.nina.no/Innsyn/nb).

### Lars Rød-Eriksen

##### Researcher

I'm a research scientist at the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), working mainly within the fields of landscape and community ecology, with a focus on mountainous, alpine and arctic ecosystems. My main background is on small to medium sized carnivores, extended over the years to include birds and ungulates. Research interests cover road ecology and climate change, and in particular anthropogenic impacts on species distributions. I'm the lead administrator of [Hønsefuglportalen](https://honsefugl.nina.no/).

### Annabel J. Slettenhaar

##### PhD candidate

I started my PhD at Nord University in Steinkjer in 2023, investigating the interaction between the gyrfalcon and the ptarmigan. For the project I am interested in their predator-prey dynamics and how climate change affects this system. I am originally from the Netherlands, where I worked on projects relating to behavioural ecology, bird migration and conservation in temperate and arctic ecosystems. My favourite thing about research is the fieldwork, and I feel very lucky to be able to do that now in the amazing Norwegian mountains!

### Saria Sato Bajracharya

##### PhD candidate

I joined Nord University in Spring 2024. I study the diet and fitness of ptarmigans under climate change. By using DNA barcoding, I will analyze fecal samples to understand how their food composition and selection varies with the timing of spring. My broad interests are in avian ecology, climate change and human impacts. Prior to joining here, I was mainly involved in research related to terrestrial ecotoxicology but also worked on seabird monitoring projects at NINA. I share my home between Japan and Nepal, and enjoy my free time climbing and biking.

### Hilvi Emerense Hamar

##### MSc student

I´m a master student in Biosciences at Nord University, Steinkjer, specializing in Terrestrial Ecology and Nature Management. Currently, I´m writing on my master´s thesis about breeding success in golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) related to climate and food availability focusing on the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), and plan to deliver it during spring 2024. I have a general interest in ecology and how everything is connected in ecosystems, but what I might find the most interesting is predator-prey interactions.

### Stian Sundsvik

##### MSc student

I’m a master’s student at Nord University, specializing in terrestrial ecology and nature management. In research, I have interest in terrestrial ecology, and specially in tetraonid ecology and management. In addition, I also enjoy working with maps in general and in GIS-software. At the time, I’m working on my master’s thesis about the detectability of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) in relation to environmental and sampling event variables.
