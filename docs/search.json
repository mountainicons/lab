The projects listed here are long-term (or - aspirational long term!) field projects that we are at leading. Students interesting in writing their thesis with us should therefore not hesitate to contact us even though you don’t find your favorite species or system listed below.\n\nThe ecology of willow ptarmigan in a changing climate\n\n\n\n\n\nFoto credit: Jan Eivind Østnes\n\n\n\n\nOne of our major projects is a field project on willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) ecology, where the focus is on how this iconic species will be affected by ongoing climate change. The project was initiated in 2015, and our main study area is in Lierne municipality in central Norway. In 2023 the study was extended to include an additional coastal study area in Namdalseid municipality, also in central Norway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to learn more about the ptarmigan project\n\n\n\n\n\nThe willow ptarmigan is a valued game species in Norway, and has a high cultural value. In addition, it is among the few avian species that stay in our mountain ecosystem throughput the year. A core element of our study has been to monitor marked individuals, but we also collect a wide array of data from unmarked birds. Based on the marked birds, we obtain information about vital rates (survival and recruitment) and movement patterns. During the breeding season, we monitor the nests of marked and unmarked birds using automatic game cameras. We also collect scats, that are used both for identifying individuals (e.g. for catpture-recapture analyses) and the diet based on DNA metabarcoding methods. The main funding for this project come from the Norwegian Environment Agency. We receive substantive help with the fieldwork from “Fjellstyrene i Lierne”, which provide valuable management relevance for our project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring and population ecology of tetraonids\n\n\n\n\n\nFoto credit: Jan Eivind Østnes\n\n\n\n\nIn Norway, tetraonid species - in particular willow ptarmigan - are monitored through a community based montoring program called “Hønsfuglportalen”. In addition to providing direct input to the management of these populations, the data collected through the program is an extremely valuable source as a basis to for research into the population dynamics of key species in our mountain ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to learn more about the monitoring and population dynamics project\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2013, we have been monitoring willow ptarmigan and other tetraonide species populations across large areas across Norway. The project can be seen as a structurured participatory (also called citizen science) monitoring program, where staff from NINA and Norwegian University for Applied Sciences provide common e-infrastructure, data management routines, study design, field protocols and education of volunteer field workers. Field work is carried out in August, and is based on line transect surveys for distance sampling estimation of abundance. The field team include a pointing dog to increase detectability of birds. Participation in the program by stakeholders (including both public and private landowners) is not mandated; thus there is no unified statistical framework that regulate the sampling effort in the different regions. Since 2022, the program has also included field surveys in Northern Finland. The program is collaborating closely with several research projects, facilitating constant improvement of the program in terms of data collection and modelling of the data.\nThe main funding for this project come from the Norwegian Environment Agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeding ecology of gyrfalcon and golden eagle in the breeding season\n\n\n\n\n\nFoto credit: Jan Eivind Østnes\n\n\n\n\nThe gyrfalcon and golden eagle are the predominant avian apex predators within the ecosystems of Scandinavian Mountain. Since 2018, we have utilized wildlife cameras to monitor active gyrfalcon nests in Lierne municipality, central Norway. In 2020, we extended this monitoring effort to include golden eagle nests. Our primary objective is to study the diet composition and feeding behaviour of gyrfalcons and golden eagles during their breeding season. As a serendipitous outcome, we have also uncovered unexpected interactions between various avian and mammalian apex predators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to learn more about gyrfalcon on golden eagle project\n\n\n\n\n\nBy collaborating with other projects, we have gained access to data on territory occupancy and nesting success of gyrfalcons and golden eagles at both regional and national scales. Additionally, we gather data on annual fluctuations in prey densities from sources such as Hønsefuglportalen and Living Norway Data Network. These combined datasets allow us to explore spatiotemporal variations in the diet and breeding success of alpine apex predators, considering both biological factors (prey densities) and abiotic factors (weather data). This also enables us to model the potential impacts of climate change on predator-prey relationships.\nThe County Governor of Trøndelag is the primary funder of this project, while fieldwork is predominantly carried out by personnel from Fjellstyrene i Lierne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation ecology and status of taiga bean goose\n\n\n\n\n\nFoto credit: Jan Eivind Østnes\n\n\n\n\nThe taiga bean goose is one of the rarest species that breeds in the mountainous regions of Norway. It has been classified as Endangered (EN) on the Norwegian Red List. Since 2010, we have been conducting a project to study the migratory behaviour and population dynamics of a small group of taiga bean geese that breed in Børgefjell National Park. The field work is mainly carried out in the mountain areas of Røyrvik municipality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to learn more about the taiga bean goose project\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the first phase of the project (2010-2015), we fitted GPS tags and neckbands on some geese to identify their breeding, moulting, and wintering grounds. Since then, we have mainly conducted non-invasive population monitoring by collecting samples (scats and shed feathers) for DNA analysis. In this regard, we have developed a method for individual and sex identification based on genetic (microsatellite) markers. We intend to use this data to model demographic rates (survival and reproduction) and population size.\nThe Norwegian Environment Agency and the County Administration of Trøndelag are the primary funders of this project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStress responses of grouse species to anthropogenic disturbance\n\n\n\n\n\nFoto credit: Jan Eivind Østnes\n\n\n\n\nHigh levels of stress may have consequences on immune responses, survival and reproduction in wild animals. Based on analyses of stress hormon levels in fecal samples, we will investigate relationships between human disturbances and stress responses of grouse (willow ptarmigan, rock ptarmigan, black grouse and capercaillie). Beyond increasing our knowledge of the biology of these species, this will give information relevant to grouse management in Norway and elsewhere."

    "text": "The effects of climate change on interaction strenth in a specialist predator-prey system: The gyrfalcon and willow ptarmigan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnabel J. Slettenhaar, PhD thesis\nIn this project we try to quantify the predator-prey dynamics between the gyrfalcon and the ptarmigan in the Norwegian mountains, and investigate how this system is or will be impacted by climate change. To do this, we start by analysing the diet of the gyrfalcon, and quantifying their numerical and functional response to changing ptarmigan densities. We will use long term monitoring data of abundance and reproductive success of both species to look at their population dynamics and to quantify bottom-up and top-down effects. To find out how the system will respond to climate change, we compare all the above with weather variables and important climatic factors such as spring timing. By looking at seasonal survival patterns of ptarmigan across different environmental contexts, we hope to gain even more detailed knowledge on how the system will respond to a changing world.\n\n\n\n\n\nLife history traits and demography of a mountain bird under climatic variation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLasse Frost Eriksen, PhD thesis\nMountains are among the ecosystems that are expected to be particularly exposed to climate change, and observed changes include increased temperatures, shorter winters, reduced snow cover, and changed precipitation patterns. In this thesis, I investigated how short-term variation in climatic factors affects life history traits and demography of willow ptarmigan. I used data from two study areas in Norway, one historical (Dovrefjell, 1978-1994) and one ongoing (Lierne, 2015-2021), to test hypotheses related to reproductive strategies, movement strategies and survival in seasonal environments, with particular focus on the role of climatic variation. My findings suggest that willow ptarmigan is sensitive to short-term variation in climatic factors, in terms of both seasonal survival and annual reproduction. Earlier and warmer springs increased reproductive success, and a later arrival of snow in the autumn and less snow in the spring increased survival prospects. The thesis contributes to better understanding of the vulnerability of willow ptarmigan and the mountain ecosystems to climatic changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreeding success and productivity in golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) in relation to climate and food availability focusing on the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHilvi Emerense Hamar, MSc-project\nIn my master’s thesis, I´m surveying breeding success and productivity in golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) from north to south of Norway for the period 2015-2023, in relation to climate and food availability focusing on the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus). I´m using golden eagle breeding data from 181 territories, collected through the intensive monitoring program of golden eagle, recorded in Rovbase, and willow ptarmigan index data from the distance sampling line transect survey, recorded in Hønsefuglportalen. Average temperature and snowfall data, and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), used to calculate maximum greenness and onset of spring, have been acquired for each territory each year of the study period. In addition, the proportion of mountain areas has been calculated in each territory, and it has been defined whether the territories are coastal or not, and if they are within areas where sheep or reindeer can reside.\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of environmental variation on life history traits in golden eagle in Northern Norway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBørje Cato Moen, MSc-project\nThe Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is a species known for its longevity and low reproduction rate. The main aim of my thesis is to investigate population dynamics, such as turnover rates, in two different regions of northern Norway. The data that will be used in my thesis have been obtained from DNA extracted from shed feathers, which were collected annually from approximately 30 territories over the past ten years."

I´m using golden eagle breeding data from 181 territories, collected through the intensive monitoring program of golden eagle, recorded in Rovbase, and willow ptarmigan index data from the distance sampling line transect survey, recorded in Hønsefuglportalen. Average temperature and snowfall data, and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), used to calculate maximum greenness and onset of spring, have been acquired for each territory each year of the study period. In addition, the proportion of mountain areas has been calculated in each territory, and it has been defined whether the territories are coastal or not, and if they are within areas where sheep or reindeer can reside."

    "text": "Figure 1: Installation of wildlife cameras on gyrfalcon nests\n\n\nIn a paper recently published in the Journal of Raptor Research, we report an instance of a juvenile northern goshawk preying upon a brood of gyrfalcon. Although there are only a handful of recorded instances of predation on gyrfalcon nestlings, there have been observations in Sweden and Russia involving pine marten and peregrine falcon, respectively. The common raven and golden eagle are suggested to be potential predators on gyrfalcon nestlings, however, there is no direct evidence to support this.\nFrom 2018 to 2022, we monitored 11 gyrfalcon nests in central Norway using motion-trigged wildlife cameras. (Fig. 1). On the night of June 5th, 2021, our cameras captured footage of a northern goshawk attacking and killing three gyrfalcon nestlings. Three hours before the attack happened, the female gyrfalcon was recorded at the nest feeding her four nestlings (Fig. 2).\n\n\nAccording to the camera footages the goshawk attacked and killed the nestlings between 02:14 and 02:35 (Fig. 2). During this time frame, none of the adult gyrfalcons were present in the images.  The absence of the gyrfalcon parents during the depredation of the brood suggests that they may not actively defend their nests against predators, instead relying on low risk of predation. At 06:12, i.e. four hours after the attack happened, the female gyrfalcon returned to the nest to feed the only surviving nestling (Fig. 2).\nBy comparing the size of the goshawk with the female gyrfalcon, we determined that the predator was a subadult female. Although goshawks typically prey on various birds and mammals, intraguild predation between goshawks and gyrfalcons is probably uncommon since they normally use different habitats. However, the proximity of gyrfalcon nests to goshawk habitats in central Norway increases the likelihood of such interactions. Predation by goshawks introduces further challenges to the survival of gyrfalcons, exacerbating threats like habitat modification and low survival rates among juveniles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Upper left: A female gyrfalcon feeding her four nestlings in the evening of 4th June, 2021.
